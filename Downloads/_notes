Entry #: 57

Finally, it's coming together. The ransomware project—my magnum opus. I've codenamed it Erebus, after 
the Greek primordial deity of darkness. It feels fitting, given what this tool is capable of.

The payload is lean, efficient, and ruthless. File encryption is nearly instantaneous, thanks 
to the hybrid model I implemented. Erebus locks the data behind a key, and there's no backdoor. Once 
it's locked, even I couldn't unlock it without the key. No forgiveness, no mercy.

Protection Measures
To avoid any accidental leaks I've added a 4-digit PIN protection for the builds. No one can run or
analyze the ransomware without the PIN. It feels like a trivial safeguard, but it's surprisingly effective. 
A simple numerical barrier can deter even skilled reverse engineers long enough for me to deploy.

The PIN system is randomized for each build, generated during compilation. If someone were to brute-force
it, they'd still need to crack into the deeper layers of obfuscation and custom packers I've wrapped it in.
It's not impenetrable, but it's good enough to give me a head start.

Progress

I've tested Erebus on sandboxed environments. It performs beautifully. Within seconds, all user documents,
spreadsheets, photos—everything—turn into gibberish. The ransom note pops up immediately after.

I'm debating whether to tweak the tone of the note. Should I go for polite professionalism or cold menace? 
The latter feels more appropriate, but people pay faster when they feel like there's hope.

Next Steps

The ransomware is complete, but the delivery method needs work. Email phishing campaigns are outdated,
even if they're still effective against a lot of targets. I'm looking into exploiting software vulnerabilities 
for a more direct infection path. Droppers hidden in legitimate downloads, maybe?

Also, I need to set up the BTC wallets. I'll use tumblers to launder the payments, but I want a fallback plan
if the blockchain analysis gets too hot. Maybe Monero.

I'll write again tomorrow once I finalize the delivery vector. Erebus is ready to step out of the shadows.
